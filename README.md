# ComicRack_FromDucks

A ComicRack plugin/script to fetch Inducks data for Disney comic books.

Version 3 of this plugin uses the open-source [DucksManager API](https://github.com/ducksmanager/core/blob/6d0a30f/packages/api/http.ts#L31-L243) to get the Inducks data in a structured way, contrary to version 2 which was scraping the Inducks website using regular expressions.

### You should consider using [ComicRack Community Edition](https://github.com/maforget/ComicRackCE). And if you can please contribute to the project.
